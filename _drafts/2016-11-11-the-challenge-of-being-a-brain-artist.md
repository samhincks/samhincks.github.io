I want to write an article about art and personality, and it might piss people off but it's what I've always thought about something I care a lot about but have not been able to express myself about nor been able to meet a community of people who thought about art the way -- until meeting members of the Burning Man community. 

In the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, I have the personality disposition not of a scientist but of an artist. Famous INFPs include William Shakespeare, Tolkien, and Bj√∂rk. 

When I apply Myers Briggs typology to myself, I wind up with the letters INFP, meaning I'm an introverted, intuitive, feeling, perceiver. 

People criticize Myers Briggs because it compresses something multi dimensional into four dimensional space, but these critics are generally scientists with high standards for the empirical grounds and predictive utility of knowledge. My goals are different. I want an easy to absorb crutch for my thinking. In addition, I want a thinking tool that allows me to reason about mind and behavior at the level of information processing. For scientists, it is premature to reason about mind at the level of information processing, and they therefore prefer the alternative method of binning adjectives that describe human traits into a minimal set of independent clusters. 

However, I doubt any of these personality psychologists actually reason about the thing they are studying, the mind, at the level of information processor. I'm a computer scientist and study information processing systems, and therefore love the starting point of Myers Briggs.



So on the scale, introversion captures the direction processing generally takes in situations that comprises and predicts most of life, which are social situations. More so than extroverts, introverts generally focus procecessing internally, enlisting default mode network computations in situations of high social informational bandwidth. Because the default mode networks hogs a lot of energy in the brain and because the introvert cycles back and forth between this network and exogenous networks, social situations drain energy more so than does it does for extroverts, who happily engage a simpler network with less energy expenditure. But this trains the default mode network for introvert and when extroverts then enter situations where they can't obtain high informational bandwidth from peers, they also regress into a default mode network, which is more poorly trained. 

Having such a trained default mode network, which stays active in social situations and which you train myself by all your solitude. I wager that I'm in the top 1% of people in my age group in the number of hours I have spent alone. I don't feel isolated since I have friends and family that I love, a strong community, and abundant weaker friendships, meaning I can pick exactly the number of hours with other people as I please.

But I essentially played video games all through childhood; then in college, I studied most of the time; then after college, I traveled countries where they don't speak English; and then I started a PhD in computers, which is mostly just sitting by your computer. So I think I'm 1% in this dimension in number of hours spent alone (but maybe I never see the people who never see people?), and it means I just have this wonderful companion Default Mode Network who tells me to be happy all the time and which frankly pushes an endless cycle of interesting material into my head, and interesting new obsession, which I love. I never get bored and I never get lonely, because this default mode network is so good to me. This attribute predisposes me to be an artist, because the default mode network, frustrating as it is as a distractor actually generates some pretty nice creative thoughts. And it means I get a lot of alone time to practice art. 

Then I'm an intuitive type, and I think the fact that I'm intuitive has made me reject the label of artist until meeting the Burning Man community. The reason that artists don't make money isn't because art isn't valuable, it's merely because they aren't doing their jobs as artists properly. Most artists are sensing types, and enjoy their skill at a particular art because of a strong connection to a particular sense, e.g. sound for musicians or visual stimuli for a painter. However, because of how the intuitive vs. sensing tradeoff must work in an information processor, it is hard to both be processing the raw low level computations of the senses and also capable of the abstractions necessary for the true creativity that would make art good. Creativity emerges when one can recognize how to combine two previously independent thinking tools; noticing how things are similar requires high degrees of abstraction. Abstraction means you are operating on computations that are many degrees removed from the senses. That's just what the word means. Many professional artists fail because they don't notice critical abstractions. So a given painter focuses on creating beauty when nature is more beautiful, a musician makes music even though there are millions of songs available. And why do you fucking dance as a living? I'm sort of teasing and this was probably too mean because I really have no idea. But if artists actually wanted to make a contribution to art, then they would work with technology, where it is possible to actually build new experiences and scale them up and share them to many other humans. 

And I don't really know what I'm talking about nor who I'm talking about, and frankly I'm just HIGH (which while there were many things that SUCKED about the election, there was a positive note.) I no longer need to lie about the fact that I like to smoke weed in public. I don't care what my family thinks about this (I think they know I use it responsibly) nor employers. In fact, being on record now as someoene who likes to smoke is great because it prevents my future self from accepting a job for someone who mind that their . The probability that you are a dick and also stupid is fractionally larger for people who drink than for people who smoke I'm relatively sure. You smoke because you want to expand consciousness or relax and you drink because you are afraid. 

Anyway that is just to say that I'm writing this high 2 days after Massachussetts legalized weed and you will have to excuse that some of my thoughts are off topic and mean and from my point of view brutally honest. 

But the reason I know artists are not doing their job is that nobody has digitized smell! I check for papers on this topic all the time. It wouldn't be too hard I don't think. There probably are a neat set of tricks as there are for capturing sounds, and applying a Fourier Transform to store it on a computer, and then playing it back by thing capable of producing soundwaves based on inforamtion. Digitizing smells just isn't as useful for things other than art which is why nobody has done it. 

But come on? Art is about programming experiences on people right? So go on and build new ways to program experiences on people. The possibilities with today's technology are SO abundant. Go learn a little programming my friends; the entire education is free online and it is not that hard! Go build shit! Why are you trying to be a fucking dancer for a living? 

You may contest that art and technology are separate but come on! How are you defining art? How can you possibly define it as anything other than systems for interfacing with brain, for writing experiences on these things in a given medium of input? Seriously, nobody has ever made art that wasn't doing this, and it's a cleaner definition. What do you mean fucking purposiveness without purpose? That's so narrow. The only reason this is having an effect on people because the rigging on hte brain. Actually, maybe it's saying the same thing as I am. It's things which are arbitrary; being so merely because they exert some effect on the brain given its senses and current structure. Maybe this is how they are defining art? I'm not sure. And maybe you could make the argument that once you are in a framework of technology you immediately enter a certain mindset and therefore cannot accept the experience of art, which I think is an objection that I accept, and say - OK, I guess I'm pretty high.

But to be honest, the artists are just too lazy to learn how to program.

Anyway, I was talking about Myers Briggs, so the third attribute that I am: is a Feeling type instead of a Thinking type. This also predisposes you to be an artist of the classical sense but in some cases especially the technology approaches I just want on a quite elitist rave about, you might be better off as a thinker. I notices this a lot since I am doing a PhD in Computer Science. Everybody is way smarter than I am when it comes to specific knowledge about computers. The reason about computers way differently than I do, having put energy into grasping specifics like how floating point numbers which are decimals are represented in binary code and how two different C implementations differ from each other. These details BORE me to death. They love them because what they love about computer science is that they get to understand the computer, in all its details. That's great but they end up so narrow in your understanding of the world and experience, which is fantastic for a society that values specialization but it makes you a fucking insect. Most Computer Scientists are IxTPs. I will explain the P part later. These folks love computers since they got to understand how the full system works. They hate this feature in their ordinary lives: they just don't get to predict shit because it's so complicated. But I'm an F guy in a T persons clothing. I'm into computer science because it's necessary for an artist. 







You're job as an artist is not to do the same damn thing as everyone else! The artist should invent new art. There's SO MUCH technology. Invent new EXPERIENCES. 
How do I know artists aren't thinking this way? Nobody has digitized smells and created a music for interfacing with people through olfaction. I look for papers on this all the time but nobody is working on it. If artists serious about art, then they wouldn't waste their career fucking painting or making the same damn music as everyone else or writing a new piece of fucking fiction, they go and digitize olfaction! It's totally feasible. Smell is a physical sensation, and you can find some hack 




There are five mediums for art. Who wants to look at fucking paintings when there's nature? You can't compete with nature, and if you want to express something, use words! I






, and it has predictive utility


 as someone who has the personality . I remember 

The challenge of being a brain artists

It's funny that sometimes it just doesn't work. I started doing the exact same thigns with the arpegiattor and I was even high when I tried but htere is some inhibition. Thats what happens where youre a one track atrist. You got haver art in many different mediums. Thats ultaimtely what you are sam my friend - you're sort of a brain artist. You know thats what you're goin be in the future, like the stuff in West World. It's an interestign show for me because thats the stuff that litarally motivates me. I want to write experiecne to the brain, which is why dont believe an aristic medium should be outside of my grasp. I need to do ANYTHING from drugs to stimulation to writing to music to practice how you do this art. There's literally not a thing I don't do because I care about brain art. DEEPLY. Some artists care enough about art that they'll master how to draw or something. I'm so obsessed that I do EVERYTHING. Write video games: check. 

But sometimes you want to make music or you want to write a paper or you want to write a program or you want to analyze brain data or whatever and it just doesn't work. 

This is the challange: being a brain artist is fucking tough. I sound like a tech guy and I pretend to be in all contexts but nope I just want art but I recognized that I didn't want to jsut be an artists I wanted to create a new field of art. I'm trying now to grow this off music. I'm studying brain stimulation and music in parallel now because

Neural networks this; Neural Networks that... How should you think about these things as a person who is not into machine learning or even computer science? 

What the does this fucking thing do other than steal my job?

The first thing to realize is that a neural network is an algorithm and an algorithm is a sequence of clear steps which maps input to output. When you have a conversation with a friend, your spoken word is the input to the brain which executes a series of algorithms, returning in the end some output in the form of language.

The second thing to realize about a neural network is that it's learning algorithm. When a given problem is designed with a neural network, it means that the programmer has not specified every piece of the solution. Instead, it specifies methods for encoding intelligence from data. The brain works that way to. DNA does not describe exact algorithms for carrying out most of your actions in adult life. Instead, it hardcodes methods for learning, and the instantiated algorithms that compose you are the combination of learning and data.

The third thing to realize is that it's painful to orchestrate the learning problem every time you want a new problem. Learning a relationship between inputs and outouts is mathematically quite easy to grasp: it's just the problem of finding an optimal set of weights for the inputs - an equation which given your inputs produces your outputs in the observations you have available. What's interesting is that this problem is what computer scientists call NP-Complete. It's not tractible to perform on a computer because of for the setting of each weight, you must try the setting of each other weight. Each weight has many possible settings and exploring every combination for all but a trivial number of weights would entail a search space that exceeded the number of steps than there are atoms in the universe. That these problems are not tractible on computers is the heart of computer science - and yet the brain seems to do it. The brain figured it out and so how have computer scientists. We use neural networks 

So a neural network treats the feature description processes as abstract. It infers an internal model which represents the equation which produces the output response from the inputs. It does so by iteratively adjusting itself based on. It must start somewhere, and so it begins in a random configuratoin. 

It uses the building block of a thing it calls the neuron, and the state of the system is represented by the the links between these neurons.

Here's how I would describe the development of my own ego over time, and it seems to me this pattern is quite common:
- 0-12: Pre-ego. I am in the state the the environment puts me in.
- 12-18: Ego birth. I begin to learn how to orient behavior and cognition so that inputs maximize self-descriptions and not the quality of experience. 
- 18:22: Ego flourishing. In the playground of college, I'm able to build up a robust ego, and withstand high entropy lifestyle.  
- 22:25: Ego destruction. The self-fantasies that sustained the college no longer apply in the real world, where my ego is now measured against better competitors. A slight regression into the self-deluding and supressing ego style.
- 25: ~: Somtimes post Ego. Recognition that I'm a computer whose state is compromised by ego, and that I can appease its desires by making it observe a being who works, exercises, and builds quality relationships, as well as intervene in my own cerebration more surgically via meditation, writing, exercise, and other therapeutics.

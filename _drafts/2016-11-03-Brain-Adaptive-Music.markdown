The brain has five channels for accepting input from the environment: sound, vision, touch, taste, and smell. Each channel is a possible pipeline towards altering the state of the brain, and as a species we are still in the early phases of describing rules for how input in a given modality affects the state of the brain. This research problem is challenging for two reasons. First, the space of possible inputs in a given modality is large. For instance, it is [estimated][vision] that the eye transmits 10 million bits of information per second, and, moreover, how a given frame is parsed depends on the previous sequences, making it an intractible combinatorial problem. Second, no two brains are alike because the genetic source code implementing their initial states is in most cases unique, and even if you are not a twin, environmental inputs (as early as the womb) immediately brings it to a unique state. 

 But I would argue that this is the basic enterprise of humanity: to attempt to specify how sequences of brain inputs coerce desirable states, and to execute these sequences on ourselves and others. This may sound dehumanizing, but this is what everybody from the drug addict to the scientist, from the dedicated parent to the struggling artist is trying to do. We're all just building interfaces for the brain. 

The focus of my PhD is to specify how digital interfaces can manipulate information spaces in order to coerce high quality attentional states: the construct psychologists refer to as [flow states][flow], meditators refer to as unified or enlightened states [waking-up], and neuroscientists refer to as [hypofrontalized][hypofrontality] or exogenous states. The work of [Marcus Aurelius][meditations], [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi][flow], [Tim Ferriss][ferriss], [Sam Harris][harris], and Robin Carhart-Harris[carart] has convinced me that attention is the mental state worth characterizing and optimizing. If the brain is mostly dedicated to processing and acting on input from the environment, then it has less energy to spare for endogenous computations, which at least in the case of my own brain is oftentimes irrelevant, needlessly self-critical, and frankly boring unless it is at work fantasizing about a better but unlikely possible reality. The premise of both Stoicism and Buddhism is that supporting an 'active', 'deluded', and 'arrogant' ego is a recipe for a boring, unproductive, and unethical life. 

Here's how I would describe the development of my own ego over time, and it seems to me this pattern is quite common:
- 0-12: Pre-ego. I am in the state the the environment puts me in.
- 12-18: Ego birth. I begin to learn how to orient behavior and cognition so that inputs maximize self-descriptions and not the quality of experience. 
- 18:22: Ego flourishing. In the playground of college, I'm able to build up a robust ego, and withstand high entropy lifestyle.  
- 22:25: Ego destruction. The self-fantasies that sustained the college no longer apply in the real world, where my ego is now measured against better competitors. A slight regression into the self-deluding and supressing ego style.
- 25: ~: Somtimes post Ego. Recognition that I'm a computer whose state is compromised by ego, and that I can appease its desires by making it observe a being who works, exercises, and builds quality relationships, as well as intervene in my own cerebration more surgically via meditation, writing, exercise, and other therapeutics. 

It's astonishing how much better life is post-ego. Technology and internet in particular so far has wrought net negative effects on human ego because of the availibility of information and positivity biases has increased ego competition. is a recipe for subtracting the brain from experience 







The interesting wrinkle that made me settle on this topic for a PhD is that the brain 

 We use a light-based neuroimaging system in order to

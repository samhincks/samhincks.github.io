The brain has five channels for accepting input from the environment: sound, vision, touch, taste, and smell. Each channel is a possible pipeline towards altering the state of the brain, and as a species we are still in the early phases of describing rules for how input in a given modality affects the state of the brain. This research problem is challenging for two reasons. First, the space of possible inputs in a given modality is large. For instance, it is [estimated][vision] that the eye transmits 10 million bits of information per second, and, moreover, how a given frame is parsed depends on the previous sequences, making it an intractible combinatorial problem. Second, no two brains are alike because the genetic source code implementing their initial states is in most cases unique, and even if you are not a twin, environmental inputs (as early as the womb) immediately brings it to a unique state. 

 But I would argue that this is the basic enterprise of humanity: to attempt to specify how sequences of brain inputs coerce desirable states, and to execute these sequences on ourselves and others. This may sound dehumanizing, but this is what everybody from the drug addict, the scientist, from the dedicated parent to the struggling artist is trying to do. We're all just building interfaces for the brain. 

The focus of my PhD is to specify how digital interfaces can manipulate information spaces in order to coerce high quality attentional states: the construct psychologists refer to as [flow states][flow], meditators refer to as unified or enlightened states [waking-up], and neuroscientists refer to as [hypofrontalized][hypofrontality] or exogenous states. The work of [Marcus Aurelius][meditations], [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi][flow], [Tim Ferriss][ferriss], [Sam Harris][harris], and Robin Carhart-Harris[carart] has convinced me that attention is the mental state worth dimensionalizing and optimizing. Attention refers to the direction and cycling of computations in the brain. 

If the brain is mostly dedicated to processing and acting on input from the environment, then it has less energy to spare for endogenous computations, which at least in the case of my own brain is oftentimes irrelevant, needlessly self-critical, and frankly boring unless it is at work fantasizing about a better but unlikely possible reality, in which case it trades my current state for my future state when I notice that bug in the artificial reality my mind had concocted. The premise of both Stoicism and Buddhism is that supporting an 'active', 'deluded', and 'arrogant' ego is a recipe for a boring, unproductive, and unethical life. 

Technology and internet in particular so far have wrought net negative effects on human ego. An interesting habit I've noticed forming in my own brain is the tendency to subconsciously open a browser and type "face" before observing with explicit brain the sequence of cognitions that brought me there. I had some uncomfortable thought, and appeased that thought using the relief of Facebook. In every case, the issue that plagues my brain can be reduced some failure of ego. It is clear that the system in the brain responsible for these cognitions is intimately tied up with some idea of me, which it tries to maximize. 

 It would be better if my brain simply recognized the default mode network as an annoying but inevitable participant of my brain, considered the thought as a product of computation, and let go of it. Nevertheless, I wind up on Facebook. What do I see there? I see terribly curated realited with an inordinate amount of positivity bias. People simply don't share negative aspects about themselves or the world, and if they do these aspects don't get upvoted as much. The new react buttons help but will not overcome the bias because people want desperately to be validated by the world. 

 The consequence is ego epidemic and an incredibly fractious political climate.





The interesting wrinkle that made me settle on this topic for a PhD is that the brain
